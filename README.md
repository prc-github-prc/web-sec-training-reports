# web-sec-training-reports
Small but growing collection of training reports based on web security training on public "hackable" websites made for hacking training.

#### Disclaimer : this files contains informations about vulnerabilities that I discovered and documented on sites that are made especially to be hacked. There is no sensitive or private information of any kind in this files. This flaws are for sure already documented on the internet. The only purpose of this project is for me to learn and progress about web security and bug bounty, and to share my work with other peoples.

As my native language is not english, please feel free to report any misspelling or grammatical error.

Unfortunetly, sometimes the pdf files can't be seen using firefox or wget, so if you still really want to see them, I recommand you to clone the repo or use another client to try to see the content.
You must also notice that even if you succefully see the files, you won't be able to click on the hyperlinks, so the best to access to this content seems to be to clone the repo.
